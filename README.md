# CCS-model-for-ONT
a novel pipeline for getting high accuracy sequence from one single molecular read

Description:

  Similar to INC-seq (https://github.com/CSB5/INC-Seq) and CCS(the Circular Consensus Sequence) model of PacBio, it's including two step: 1, Amplification 2,Consensus algorithm
  Main difference is the Amplification. Here we descibed a novel technology: 'self-amplification' which is simple and quick.
