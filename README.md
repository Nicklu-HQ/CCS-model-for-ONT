# CCS-model-for-ONT
a novel pipeline for getting high accuracy sequence from one single molecular read
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Description:

    similar to INC-seq (https://github.com/CSB5/INC-Seq) and CCS(the Circular Consensus Sequence) model of PacBio

    It's including two step 
    1: Amplification       : Here we descibed a novel technology: 'self-amplification' which is simple and quick.
    2: Consensus Algorithm : Blastn for mapping and Pbdagcon for consensus
 
Example:

Raw Data:

    some raw sequence data from the MinION of Oxford Nanopore and consensus data could been found in the file XXXXX
