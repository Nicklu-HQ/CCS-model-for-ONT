# CCS-model-for-ONT
a novel pipeline for getting high accuracy sequence from one single molecular read

Description:

  It's including two step (similar to INC-seq (https://github.com/CSB5/INC-Seq) and CCS(the Circular Consensus Sequence) model of PacBio): 1: Amplification      : Here we descibed a novel technology: 'self-amplification' which is simple and quick.
2: Consensus Algorithm: Blastn for mapping and Pbdagcon for consensus
 
Example:



Pipeline:



  
Amplifcation principle:


Raw Data:

  some raw sequence data from the MinION of Oxford Nanopore and consensus data could been found in the file XXXXX
